Google Apps Scripts to faciliate or suppor my daily work in Google Workspace:
1. Gmail
2. Sheets
3. Calendar

Except for functions in `gmail` dir, other scripts are not for general use.

Under the `sheet` folder, there are two fully-functioning, application-like programs:
1. [CDL helpers](https://github.com/Linerre/gsuite-tools/tree/master/sheet/CDL-helpers)
2. [Orderly](https://github.com/Linerre/gsuite-tools/tree/master/sheet/orderly)
